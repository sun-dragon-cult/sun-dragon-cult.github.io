The amount\\nof deprecation warnings are greatly reduced, but there are some still left since they require larger\\nrewrites that will come later. They should not impact the functionality though.\\n\\nThere are not a lot of new features in this release, but the styling in various places have been\\nupdated to look more like Foundry v13. The system no longer uses the deprecated TinyMCE editor,\\ninstead it uses ProseMirror for text editing.\\n\\nAlso in the previous versions you did not get strike rank buttons for unlinked actors, this release\\nwill show those buttons for unlinked actors as well. See\\n[SR Buttons](https://sun-dragon-cult.github.io/release-notes/rqg-v3.1.0#add-sr-buttons-to-actor-sheet)\\nfor more info about how they work.\\n\\nFoundry v13 have a system where you can see the last chat even if you have the chat collapsed. This\\nRQG version introduces a user level setting so you can decide if the chat should be expanded when\\nyou roll something. That should make the feeling more similar to how it was before. It is off by\\ndefault, so you need to enable it in the settings if you want that behavior.\\n\\n![](setting-activate-chat.png)\\n\\nThere are now links to the Release Notes (this), Documentation and Bug Reports (Github issues) under\\nthe settings sidebar for easy reference.\\n\\n![](setting-links.png)\\n\\n## Add copyable RQID journal link to RQID editor\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"765\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nA small new feature in this version is that you can now get a premade Rqid link string that you can\\npaste into your journals if you want a link to a \\"type\\" of document. This is not a new feature, but\\nbefore you had to type the link manually. Now you get a premade string that you can use from the\\nRqid editor that you can open via the <LightInvertSvg src=\\"/img/rqid.svg\\" width=\\"18\\" /> icon in the\\ndocument titlebar. The styling of the dialog was also slightly improved.\\n\\n![](rqid-editor-journal-link.png)\\n\\nAfter pasting that string into the journal it will look like this. You can tell if the link is a\\ndefault Foundry UUID link or a RQID link by the surrounding border.

The dialogs are built with Foundry ApplicationV2, so\\nthey will adjust to your light/dark mode Foundry setting, see below.\\n\\nThe visual representation of these rolls in the chat are also completely rewritten, and tries to be\\nmore easily scannable for the eye by using visual clues for different success levels, bold text for\\nwhat is rolled, and by adding toned down background images according to what is rolled. Another\\ndesign intent is to keep the chat messages as small as possible to not clutter the chat. In line\\nwith that is the expand roll feature, which will show the modifiers used in the roll if the roll is\\nclicked.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Ability Check\\n\\n![](ability-check-rune.png) ![](ability-check-rune-light.png)\\n\\nAt the top it will display what ability you are rolling for (rune, skill, passion or reputation),\\nand the \\"native\\" percent chance.\\n\\nIn the middle you can see\\n\\n- **Actor** - the token actor that is doing the ability check.\\n- **Augment** - a dropdown to choose any augments in effect.\\n- **Meditate** - a dropdown to choose any meditations in effect.\\n- **Other Modifier** - a text field to enter any other modifiers. This is not a dropdown, so you can\\n  enter anything you want, both in the describing text field, and in the numeric percentage\\n  modification field. It will be shown in the expanded roll in the chat message.\\n\\nAt the bottom you can see the target percentage that you will roll against. You can also select the\\nroll mode (Public Roll, GM Private Roll, GM Roll or Self Roll). And to the right is a button to do\\nthe roll and open a chat message to show the result.\\n\\n![](chat-rune.png) ![](chat-rune-expanded.png)\\n\\nThe chat message will show what was rolled, what token that did the roll, the result of the roll,\\nand if you click the \\"Success\\" line it will expand to show what modifiers were used.\\n\\nThe \\"Success\\" line will be differently styled depending on the result of the roll to make it quick\\nand easy to see the outcome. It shows the result (Fumble / Fail / Success / Special / Critical), the\\nresult of the dice roll, and the target you need to roll under.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Characteristic Check\\n\\n![](characteristic-check.png)\\n\\nSimilar to the ability check, but for characteristics. At the top it will show the characteristic\\nname and value.\\n\\nIn the middle you can see\\n\\n- **Actor** - the token actor that is doing the characteristic check.\\n- **Difficulty** - a dropdown to choose the difficulty (multiplier) of the roll.\\n- **Augment** - a dropdown to choose any augments in effect.\\n- **Meditate** - a dropdown to choose any meditation that is done.\\n- **Other Modifier** - a text field to enter any other modifiers.

At the top it will show the spell name\\nand properties.\\n\\nIn the middle you can see\\n\\n- **Actor** - the token actor that is casting the spell.\\n- **Level** - how many magic points you will use to cast the spell. This value is only possible to\\n  edit if the spell is variable.\\n- **Boost** - how many magic points you will use to boost the spell to overcome any defences.\\n- **Augment** - a dropdown to choose any augments in effect\\n- **Meditate** - a dropdown to choose any meditation that is done.\\n- **Other Modifier** - a text field to enter any other modifiers.

And the chat message will look like this\\nwhen the result is expanded to show any modifiers.\\n\\n![](chat-rune-magic-expanded.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Combat \u2013 Attack & Defence\\n\\nThe way combat works has changed. Ideally you should have a token selected that is the target of the\\nattack before clicking the weapon you want to attack with. It is possible to use this without\\nsetting a target, and instead let anyone defend, but you cannot aim an attack unless you have a\\ntarget selected.\\n\\n![](attack.png)\\n\\nSimilar to the ability check, but for attacking someone. At the top it will show the skill name, and\\nthe \\"native\\" percent chance.\\n\\nIn the middle you can see\\n\\n- **Attacking Actor** - the token actor that is doing the attack. If you own more than one actor\\n  (token) you can change the actor via this dropdown.\\n- **Defending Actor** - This will display the name of the targeted token, or say \\"No target\\n  selected\\" if none is selected. You can only have one token targeted, if you have selected more\\n  than one you will get a notification about that, and one of them (whatever happens to be the\\n  \\"first\\") will be used as the target.\\n- **Attacking Weapon** - the weapon that is used to attack. The dropdown will contain the weapons\\n  the attacking actor has equipped.\\n- **Usage** - this decides how the weapon will be used, for example one-handed or two-handed. The\\n  dropdown will contain the options that are available for the selected weapon.\\n- **Damage Bonus From** - This can be used to get the damage bonus from an animal you are riding on\\n  if you are doing a charge. It is preselected to the attacking actor, but can be changed to any\\n  other token on the current scene that you are the owner of that is not a humanoid.\\n- **Extra Damage** - You can add either a number or a roll formula here. It can for example be used\\n  to get the extra damage from a bladesharp spell to be part of the damage calculations.\\n- **Hit Location Formula** - The dropdown contains 3 options; the normal `1d20`, `1d10` & `1d10+10`\\n  to allow attacking from below or above. If \\"Aimed Blow\\" (below) is selected, this will be disabled\\n  since you will hit the hit location chosen there.\\n\\n**Below the \\"Modifiers\\" heading there are different modifiers you can apply**\\n\\n- **Aimed Blow** - If you have a target selected, you can choose to aim the blow to hit a specific\\n  hit location. The dropdown will show the hit locations of the target. Selecting a hit location\\n  here will halve the base percentage chance.\\n- **Augment** - a dropdown to choose any augments in effect\\n- **Prone Target** - checking this checkbox will add a +40% modifier to the target chance.\\n- **Unaware Target** - checking this checkbox will add a +40% modifier to the target chance.\\n- **Darkness** - checking this checkbox will add a -75% modifier to the target chance.\\n- **Halved Chance** - checking this checkbox will halve the base percentage chance.\\n- **Other Modifier** - a text field to enter any other modifiers. This is not a dropdown, so you can\\n  enter anything you want, both in the describing text field, and in the numeric percentage\\n  modification field. It will be shown in the chat message.\\n\\nAt the bottom you can see the target percentage that you will roll against, as well as buttons with\\nthe attack modes you can do with the selected weapon. Clicking one of these buttons will give this\\nchat message:\\n\\n![](chat-attacked.png)\\n\\nIf there is a target selected, only users that own that target will see the defend button. Clicking\\nit will open the defence dialog:\\n\\n![](defend.png)\\n\\nThis is similar to the attack dialog, but for defending an attack against you. At the top it will\\nshow the skill name, and the \\"native\\" percent chance.\\n\\nIn the middle you can see\\n\\n- **Attacking Actor** - the token actor that is doing the attack.\\n- **Defending Actor** - This will display the name of the targeted token, or present a dropdown of\\n  tokens you own that are part of the current scene. If you do not have a token that can defend you\\n  will instead see a notification about that instead of this dialog.\\n- **Defence** - Depending on what the Defending Actor can do you will see a dropdown with \\"Parry\\",\\n  \\"Dodge\\" and \\"Ignore\\". Changing this will affect the rest of the dialog, hiding or showing\\n  different parts.\\n\\n- **Parrying Weapon** - the weapon that is used to parry with. The dropdown will contain the weapons\\n  the attacking actor has equipped that can be used for parry.\\n- **Usage** - this decides how the weapon will be used, for example one-handed or two-handed. The\\n  dropdown will contain the options that are available for the selected weapon.\\n\\n**Below the \\"Modifiers\\" heading there are different modifiers you can apply**\\n\\n- **Augment** - a dropdown to choose any augments in effect\\n- **Subsequent Defence Modifier** - the dropdown lets you choose the penalty for defending against\\n  multiple attacks.\\n- **Halved Chance** - checking this checkbox will halve the base percentage chance.\\n- **Other Modifier** - a text field to enter any other modifiers. This is not a dropdown, so you can\\n  enter anything you want, both in the describing text field, and in the numeric percentage\\n  modification field. It will be shown in the chat message.\\n- **Master Opponent Penalty** - if the attacker has a chance above 100% you can get a penalty to the\\n  defence here. If you have over 100% on the defence, the attacking roll will get a penalty.\\n\\nAt the bottom you can see the target percentage that you will roll against, as well as a button to\\ndo the selected defence.\\n\\nPressing that button will roll the attack and defence rolls, and update the previous chat message\\nwith info about the rolls, and the outcome from the attack/parry, or the attack/dodge table like\\nthis:\\n\\n![](chat-defended.png)\\n\\nThe rolls can be expanded to reveal the modifiers applied. Depending on the outcome you will see\\ndifferent things, but in this example clicking on the button \\"Roll Damage & Hit Location\\" will do\\nthese rolls, and update the chatmessage with the outcome of those as well:\\n\\n![](chat-damage-rolled-expanded.png)\\n\\nAgain exactly what will be show will depend on the outcome, but in this example the damage roll was\\nclicked to show the details of the damage roll, and you can apply the damage to the parrying weapon,\\nand also apply the damage that went through the weapon to the defenders head.\\n\\nClicking \\"Apply Damage to Weapon\\" will reduce the HP of the weapon (in this case the defending\\nweapon).\\n\\nClicking \\"Apply Damage to Actor\\" will apply the rolled damage to head, reducing AP unless the blow\\nshould ignore armor. If the damage is stopped by the armor a ui notification will inform about that\\nnothing went through.\\n\\nThe buttons will disappear when clicked, leaving a summary of the attack in the chat.\\n\\n![](chat-damage-applied.png)\\n\\nExporting the chat will also give a summary of what happened:\\n\\n```\\n[5/14/2025, 1:13:16 PM] Uzko (Dark Troll) token\\nattacks Vasana token\\nAttackRoll: 39 / 65 = Success\\nDefenceRoll: 54 / 90 = Success\\nAttacker rolls normal damage.Defender\u2019s parrying weapon takes 1 HP damage if damage more than its current HP.

/>\\n\\nThere are now two modes on the actor sheet, <ThemeInvert><EditModeSvg /></ThemeInvert> **Edit Mode**\\nand <ThemeInvert><PlayModeSvg /></ThemeInvert> **Play Mode**. You can switch between the modes by\\nclicking on those icons in the actor sheet title bar.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nTo be able to switch between the edit & play mode you need to be a trusted player or higher. Even\\nnormal players can edit their values if their GM switches the mode for them, but they can not change\\nmode themselves.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nIn edit mode it is possible to edit characteristics, rune, skill & passion values. The screenshot of\\nthe skills tab, shows the gained chance input field. The percent chance shown to the right is the\\n\\"normal\\" chance that includes both base chance and skill category bonus, as well as the gained\\nchance.\\n\\n![](edit-mode-skills.png)\\n\\nTo make it easy to see what mode the actor is in, a lot of accent colors are changed to green when\\nit is in edit mode.\\n\\nPlay mode hides some things for the GM to make the actor sheet less cluttered. An example of this is\\nthe `Creature?` toggle that only is available in edit mode.\\n\\nA new actor starts in edit mode, this means that after this upgrade all actors will be in edit mode.\\nYou can easily fix that by clicking on the edit mode toggle, or you can run a script that will be\\nsupplied separately.\\n\\n## Add gear items directly from actorSheet\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"671\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nIt is now possible for players (and GMs) to add new gear (gear, currency & consumables) themselves\\nby clicking on a + icon.\\n\\n![](add-gear.png)\\n\\n## Loosen duplicate embedded item name check\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"672\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nAs a followup to being able to create new gear, it is now also possible to have duplicates.\\nPreviously you could only have one gear, armor or weapon named the same, but now you can have as\\nmany as you like.\\n\\n## Drag a weapon to a pack animal without adding the weapon skills\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"450\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nIf you drag a weapon to an actor the skills linked to that weapon will also be added so that the\\nactor can use the weapon. This is good in most cases, but if you drag a spear to a horse it doesn\'t\\nmake sense that the horse gets the skill to fight with that spear. This issue is solved by checking\\nif the actor you drag the weapon to has arms (specifically a hitlocation with the rqid\\n`i.hit-location.right-arm`) and if it doesn\'t it won\'t add the skills.\\n\\n## Background tab biography field should be player editable\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"670\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nOnly the GM could edit the biography text field on the background tab of the actor sheet.

You can still drag-n-drop to the area but it is hopefully an easier way to adding these.\\n\\nThe lists are populated by looking in compendiums for rqids of rune and hit locations, so if you\\nwould like to add more runes / hit locations, you would need to create a compendium and assign a new\\nrqid to them.\\n\\n![](rune-hit-location-links.png)\\n\\n## Make Hero Points an opt-in setting\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"661\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nHero points are not part of the standard rules but was still shown on the character sheet.

It also simplifies the administration of what\\nset of wiki you want since it will be handled by activating / deactivating modules instead of\\nspecialised settings in the system. Having them as a separate module also simplifies releasing\\nupdates since the module can be released independently of the system.\\n\\nThe previous compendium packs were built for the previous Foundry database NeDB, but the new wiki\\nmodule builds database files for the v11+ database \\"classic level\\" so Foundry does not need to\\nconvert them at startup anymore.\\n\\n## Add SR buttons to actor sheet\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"620\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nFor linked actors that currently are in combat there is now a row of 12 SR buttons. Clicking one of\\nthose will add a combatant to the current combat tracker at that SR, and clicking it again will\\nremove it. There is also a \u24d8 icon with a tooltip that has a reminder about how many SR various\\nactions take. The DEX SR and SIZ SR are visualised by background color as an aid when using this.\\n\\n![](sr-buttons.png)\\n\\n## Reset Initiative removes duplicate combatants\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"509\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe top of the combat tracker is updated so that the \\"Reset Initiative\\" \u21ba button clears all\\nduplicate combatants and their SRs. The previous buttons \\"Roll All\\" & \\"Roll NPCs\\" are removed since\\nthey make no sense for RQG.\\n\\n## Missile weapon SR buttons\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"510\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"504\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nMissile weapons now have buttons for populating the combat tracker at the SRs they can shoot. For\\nweapons with rate S/MR there are two buttons depending on if you start the round with a loaded arrow\\nor not. The Range and Rate of missile weapons are now shown, both on the combat tab and on the gear\\ntab.\\n\\n![](missile-sr-buttons.png)\\n\\n## Actor name extendedName field\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"549\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe actor name is now divided into the name field and an extendedName / epithet field. The intended\\nuse is to keep the name short since that is what is displayed in sidebars, chat etc. The epithet\\nfield could then be used for family names or descriptive addons like \\"son of Herila\\" or \\"the dragon\\nslayer\\". As part of this change the layout of the header was also updated, and if the actorsheet\\nwidth is reduced the image is hidden to conserve space.\\n\\n![](epithet.png)\\n\\n## Integration with module Drag Ruler\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"618\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nIf you have the module [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) active then you will\\nget feedback on how far you can move your token. By default the green color means you are within\\nattack range, a yellow color means you can get there but cannot attack. Red color means you cannot\\nget there.\\n\\nThere is also support for an optional rule that lets you sprint further than your MOV. See \\"Speed\\nProvider\\" settings in the drag ruler module settings.\\n\\n## Smaller bug fixes, features and refactorings\\n\\n- Actors now fall unconscious when they reach zero magic points\\n  <GithubIssue issue=\\"414\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n- CON 0 gives wrong Max ENC <GithubIssue issue=\\"610\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n- Improve restart settings code <GithubIssue issue=\\"616\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n- Improve Active Effect tab by showing a link to the item an AE originates from\\n  <GithubIssue issue=\\"617\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n- add translations for sheet names (items, actor & rollTable)\\n- fix error message for non integer ENC Factor values\\n- make default item icon colors black in the settings dialog"},{"id":"rqg-v3.0.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v3.0.0","source":"@site/release-notes/rqg/v3.0.x/2023-08-08-v3.0.0.mdx","title":"RQG 3.0.0","description":"Supported Foundry Versions","date":"2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"rqg","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/rqg"},{"inline":true,"label":"foundry-update","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/foundry-update"},{"inline":true,"label":"rqg-3","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/rqg-3"}],"readingTime":3.48,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rqg-v3.0.0","title":"RQG 3.0.0","tags":["rqg","foundry-update","rqg-3"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"RQG 3.1.0","permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v3.1.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"RQG 2.2.6","permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v2.2.6"}},"content":"![Supported Foundry Versions](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://foundryshields.com/version?url=https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/releases/download/v3.0.0/system.json)\\n![Download Count](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/v3.0.0/rqg.zip)\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nThis release drops support for Foundry 10 and introduces support for Foundry 11, so you need to\\nupdate Foundry to v11 before you can update this system to v3.0.0\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## New hit location view for humanoids and improved wounded indications\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"290\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nFor actors with humanoid hitlocations the display is now more graphical.

The full changelog can be found here\\n[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\\n\\n## Weapon\'s skills link _[Breaking!]_\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"290\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nPreviously the link from weapon items to the skills that\'s needed to use them used a Foundry uuid to\\npoint to a skill when the weapon item was not embedded and a item id to point to the skill item on\\nthe same actor when then weapon item was embedded on an actor. This meant that if the weapon skill\\nin your world was deleted, then all weapon pointing to that skill would be broken. Now the skill\\nitem is referenced with a rqid instead, which means that as long as you have at least one skill item\\nin your world or compendium with the correct rqid, the weapon item will find it. Hopefully this will\\nmake the setup more resilient to changes in your worlds.\\n\\nThe Migration will try to find the skill previously linked and use the rqid on that skill to update\\nto the new way of linking skills, if it fails (because it can\'t find a skill with an rqid on it) it\\nwill save the previous values and show \\"NOT FOUND\\" when the weapon use tab is shown, and hovering\\nwill tell you the content of the previous links. In this screenshot the weapon was broken even\\nbefore the migration since both links were \\"undefined\\".\\n\\n![](not-found-weapon-skill-link.png)\\n\\n## Rqid Batch Editor steps\\n\\nStarting to use Rqids for linking weapon skills is a big change and to migrate your worlds I\'ve\\nincorporated a \\"Batch Rqid Editor\\" that is run before the actual migration scrips in order to set\\nRqids on the items that needs it (similar to the CoC one if you\'ve seen that one). It will go\\nthrough all items in your world and for each item that is missing an rqid it will display a row for\\neach distinct name (for example Jump) to let you set the rqid for all items with that name.\\nCurrently it will show forms to set Rqids for skill, rune magic & hit location items one after the\\nother. If it finds an exact match for the name of an item with an existing item that already has a\\nset rqid, then it will autofill that rqid in the form. The \\"Existing Rqids\\" dropdown lists all Rqids\\nthat exist in the system.\\n\\nThere is a \\"magic wand\\" icon to the right of the rqid input field that will take the name of the\\nitem and convert that into a rqid. That can speed up the entering of data a lot, but take care to\\ntry and use the already existing Rqids where possible. The rqid should be in english even if you\\nhave translated the system.\\n\\n**\u26a0 One word of caution** - on my machine the form makes Chrome crash on larger worlds, and after a\\nlot of debugging I came to the conclusion that it was a Chrome extension that went haywire when it\\nsaw this form with all those input fields. It\'s not so fun to come half way into filling this form\\nonly to have everything disappear, so if you want to be on the safe side I would recommend doing the\\nmigration in an incognito window without any extensions.\\n\\n### \u2460 Skills\\n\\nThe important ones to set Rqid on are the weapon skills and Dodge, Jump, Move Quietly & Spirit\\nCombat. The others can be left blank. When it comes to weapon skills there has been a lot of\\nvariation historically what they have been called. Even though it will currently work whatever rqid\\nyou set, I recommend to try and follow this standard for the rqid:\\n\\n**Melee-weapon skills** usually are called something like `1H Daggers (Dagger)` note plural on the\\ncategory `Daggers` which translates to a rqid of `i.skill.1h-daggers-dagger`. Most of you probably\\ndo not have offhand skills, but if you do, the rqid should be the same as the primary hand skill\\nwith a `-offhand` suffix, for example `1h-daggers-dagger-offhand`. There are exceptions like\\nQuarterstaff that only is a category with no specialisation.\\n\\n**Missile-weapon skills** follow the same pattern of category (specialisation), `Javelins (Javelin)`\\nor as rqid `i.skill.javelins.javelin`.\\n\\n**Natural weapon skills** partly follow the same pattern for fist type weapons `Fists (Fist)`, but\\nthere are also one of a kind types like `Grapple` etc.\\n\\n![](weapon-skill-rqids.png)\\n\\n### \u2461 Rune Magic Spells\\n\\nThe system only cares about the common rune magic spells (Command Cult Spirit, Divination, Sanctify,\\nSummon Cult Spirit, Dismiss Magic, Extension, Multispell, Find Enemy, Heal Wound, Soul Sight, Spirit\\nBlock, and Warding). It is used to mark these spells in the rune magic spell list on the actor sheet\\n(see screenshot further down )\\n\\n### \u2462 Hit Locations\\n\\nThe Hit location needs Rqids to make the token hud effects work as they should (the protection\\neffect will search for humanoid bodyparts on the actor). Please set Rqids on the human hitlocations\\n\\"Head\\", \\"Left Arm\\", \\"Right Arm\\", \\"Chest\\", \\"Abdomen\\", \\"Left Leg\\" & \\"Right Leg\\" to the \\"humanoids\\"\\nversion of Rqids. You might see more rows depending on what creatures you have in your world, but\\nyou can ignore the other hitlocations and leave them unset.\\n\\n![](hit-location-rqids.png)\\n\\n## New Syntax for custom active effects _[Breaking!]_\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"442\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe syntax for custom Active Effects that affect items have changed. This is a breaking change and\\nwill need manual fixing when encountered. The syntax for custom Active Effects previously was\\n`<item type>`:`<item name>`:`<affected path>` (for example skill:Dodge:system.baseChance). This is\\nnow changed to `<rqid>`:`<affected path>` (for example i.skill.dodge:system.baseChance). This makes\\nthe AE work in any language as well as simplifying the logic when embedding an item with an AE on an\\nactor. The rqid for an item can be found by opening the item sheet and clicking \\"Rqid\\" in the sheet\\nwindow header. The custom AE now also works on string values (previously it only worked on numbers).\\nFor example you could make an effect that increases weapon damage by 1d6 by setting the \\"Attribute\\nKey\\" to i.weapon.broadsword:system.usage.oneHand.damage and the \\"Effect Value\\" to +1d6.\\n\\n![not-found](string-active-effect.png)\\n\\nWhen you load your world you will get warning logs in the browser console (F12) looking something\\nlike this if you have active effects using the old syntax.\\n\\n![](old-ae-warning.png)\\n\\nFoundry does not let you edit AE on embedded items, so to fix an actor with a broken AE you need to\\ndrag the item to the sidebar, delete the item from the actor, edit the AE on the item and then drag\\nit back to the actor.\\n\\nPlease note that I still consider the custom Active Effects as experimental (only a little less so\\nafter this change).\\n\\n## Sub cult refactoring _[Breaking!]_\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"343\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe previous cult item could not model Orlanths different subcults and still have one rune pool for\\nall of them. Now there is a concept of \\"deity\\" and \\"sub cults\\". Currently this is mostly important\\nfor Orlanth, so if you already have a cult item with the deity Orlanth, when you drag another\\nsubcult of Orlanth to the actor they will get merged so that they share the same pool of rune\\npoints. You can also edit the subcults of a cult item in \\"Cult\\" tab on the cult item sheet.\\n\\n**\u26a0 Please note that if you had entered text in the previous field \\"Subcults\\" that is now gone.**\\nSo before upgrading it could be wise to look at that field for any actors where it might be\\nimportant (read PC actors) and note what subcults they should have so you can manually add them\\nafter the upgrade!\\n\\n## add common rune magic when embedding a cult\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"153\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe cults supplied with the system now has a list of common rune magic spells that you get when\\njoining the cult (there is a field in the cult item sheet where they are listed). When dragging a\\ncult to an actor the actor will get all of those added. Most cults have the same set, but there are\\nexceptions (like Eurmal that has fewer).\\n\\nNote that existing cults items will not get retrofitted with the common runemagic spells\\nautomatically. The common runemagic spells will be marked on the actor sheet with a cult symbol as\\nlong as they got the correct Rqid in the pre-migration Rqid form.\\n\\n![](common-rune-magic-marks.png)\\n\\n## Token HUD Effects\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"54\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe token effects have been updated to match some magic spells, like protection (1 - 4), strength,\\nBefuddle, Bladesharp, Bludgeon, Coordination, Counter magic, Demoralize, Dullblade, Fanatacism,\\nFireblade, Glamour, Glue, Ironhand, Lantern, Light, Mobility, Parry, Shimmer, Slow, Spirit screen,\\nVigour, as well as some of the previously ones like Asleep, Prone etc. In addition there are 6\\ngeneral purpose effects. If you install the module\\n[Times Up](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/times-up), the effects with a background all disappear\\nafter 10 melee rounds, and the ones with a brighter orange background actually affect the actor as\\nwell (using active effects).\\n\\n![](token-effects.png)\\n\\n## ActorSheet wounded effects\\n\\nThe actor sheet now makes wounds more immersive, starting with a red tint if the actor is wounded\\ngoing through blurring and eventually greyscale if the actor is shocked, unconscious or dead.\\n\\n## Skills without specialisation warning on Actor Sheet\\n\\nPreviously you would get a dialog forcing you to specify the specialization of a skill that had an\\nunspecified specialization (...) when you dragged it to an actor. Now the skill is embedded - but\\nyou get a warning on the skill-tab that you should complete the skill by entering what the skill\\nspecialization is.\\n\\n![](skill-specialization-warning.png)"}]}}')}}]);
