Now hit location names are no \\nlonger used for identification so they can be translated without affecting functionality. There is most likely still rough \\nedges when it comes to translations, but from this version everything should be translatable.\\n\\n## Improve UX of missile weapons & projectiles \u2013 [Issue #154](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/154) & [Issue #492](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/492)\\nIn previous versions only the GM could select what arrows a bow should use. With this update the players can do that \\nthemselves in the combat tab on the actor sheet. The quantity of projectiles and thrown weapons can now be edited \\ndirectly in the combat tab as well. The input fields have a slightly brighter color than the rest of the sheet. And \\nhopefully it should be easier to understand how much ammo you have.\\nPlease note that only equipped ammo will be shown in the dropdown.\\n![](no-ammo.png)\\n![](ammo-dropdown.png)\\n\\n## Use rqid for armor coverage and remove hit locations setting \u2013 [Issue #379](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/379) & [Issue #380](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/380)\\nThe hitlocations were previously identified by name, and the available hitlocations were defined in a setting. That \\nsetting is now removed and  the compendiums in the world are now scanned by the system for hit location rqids. This is \\npart of making hit locations translatable, but it also makes it more important that the hit locations actually have a \\nproper rqid, since that is used to identify what an armor item protects.\\n\\nYou can either drag and drop a hit location item to the \\"Hit locations\\" area on the armor item or select one in the \\ndropdown to add it to the set of hit locations the armor item protects.\\n![](armor-sheet.png)\\n![](armor-dropdown.png)\\n\\n## Change the hit location \\"Connected to\\" field to use rqid instead \u2013 [Issue #449](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/449)\\nTo completely remove any use of hit location names for identification, the \\"Connected to\\" property now also uses rqid.\\nA hit location item \\"Connected to\\" setting is used in damage calculations. Hit locations that have a \\"for damage \\ncalculations act as\\" set to \\"Limb\\" and also are \\"Connected to\\" a hit location that have \\"for damage calculations act as\\" \\nset to \\"Abdomen\\" will become useless if the Abdomen hit location gets a hard blow.\\n\\nAlso since the rqid now is so important for hit location items it is shown among the other properties (see screenshot). \\nIf you need to edit it, the normal fingerprint icon in the header will open the rqid editor.\\n\\nThe \\"Connected to\\" dropdown is populated by the hit locations in compendiums that have a hit location rqid.\\n\\n![](hit-location-connectedto.png) \\n\\n## Bug Fixes & Improvements\\n- add headbutt & hit as combat maneuvers\\n- spirit Combat panel should not be visible without spirit combat skill \u2013 [Issue #658](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/658)"},{"id":"rqg-v3.2.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v3.2.1","source":"@site/releaseNotes/rqg/v3.2.x/2023-10-26-v3.2.1.md","title":"Release Notes RQG 3.2.1","description":"\u2022 This release contains a few bugfixes and improvements.

This worked for the majority of weapons, but could not capture exceptions like sling that is a\\nprojectile weapon, but anyway should get half damage bonus.\\n\\nStarting with this version you need to add `+db` or `+db/2` to the damage string of the weapon if you want it to include a damage bonus.\\nThe damage listed in the Weapons & Equipment books are expressed in the same way (except they write halv damage bonus like `+\xbddb`).\\n\\nThere is a migration included that should update all existing damage strings.\\n\\n![](weapon-db.png)\\n\\n## Make runes translatable by using rqid for linking \u2013 [Issue #270](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/270)\\nPrevious versions used the name of rune items for linking to them, with this change the rqid of the runes are used instead. This\\nshould make it possible to translate the name of the runes.\\n\\nThe links that were changed was; opposing & minor runes links in the rune item, cult item runes, rune magic item runes, and skill runes (used for sorcery spells until a dedicated sorcery spell item type exists). With this change the system setting for the name of the magic rune was removed and the rqid of the magic rune is now a CONFIG instead (set to `i.rune.magic-condition` by default).\\n\\nThere are migrations for all the item changes needed for this.\\n\\n\\n## Improvements to the rqid editor \u2013 [Issue #457](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/457) and [Issue #642](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/642)\\n\\nThe Rqid editor field for the id now autofills the part of the id that fully depends on the document type. It also handles setting\\nlanguage and priority better when creating a new rqid. You will get default values for that when you set a rqid.\\n\\nThe info display, as well as the list of other items with the same rqid now has an improved display of what folder the document is\\nlocated in.\\n\\n![](rqid-editor.png)\\n\\n## Hide Opposing / Minor rune settings depending on runeType on Rune Item Sheet \u2013 [Issue #269](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/269)\\nThe settings for opposing and minor runes in the rune item sheet are now only shown when they are relevant according to the type of the rune.\\n\\n## Bug fixes\\n\\n- Name of special damage in chat damage roll is impale even for slash damage \u2013 [Issue #629](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/629)\\n- Actor without POW / MP is shown as unconscious and also show MP input field \u2013 [Issue #631](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/631)\\n- Null exception if hit location lacks rqid flag \\"id\\" when dragged to actorSheet\\n- Combat panel SR button is not right aligned for natural weapons"},{"id":"rqg-v3.1.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v3.1.1","source":"@site/releaseNotes/rqg/v3.1.x/2023-09-29-v3.1.1.md","title":"Release Notes RQG 3.1.1","description":"The previous release contained a serious bug that prevented actor sheets to be opened if there were not any ongoing combat.","date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 29, 2023","tags":[{"label":"rqg","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/tags/rqg"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/tags/release"},{"label":"changelog","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/tags/changelog"}],"readingTime":0.19,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rqg-v3.1.1","title":"Release Notes RQG 3.1.1","tags":["rqg","release","changelog"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release Notes RQG 3.2.0","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v3.2.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release Notes RQG 3.1.0","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v3.1.0"}},"content":"The previous release contained a serious bug that prevented actor sheets to be opened if there were not any ongoing combat.\\n\\n## Bug Fixes\\n- Impossible to open character sheets, closes [#627](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/627)\\n- Missing translation on weapon itemSheet"},{"id":"rqg-v3.1.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v3.1.0","source":"@site/releaseNotes/rqg/v3.1.x/2023-09-27-v3.1.0.md","title":"Release Notes RQG 3.1.0","description":"This release requires a separate wiki module to be installed and activated.

It also simplifies the administration of what set of wiki you want since it will be handled by\\nactivating / deactivating modules instead of specialised settings in the system. Having them as a separate module also simplifies\\nreleasing updates since the module can be released independently of the system.\\n\\nThe previous compendium packs were built for the previous Foundry database NeDB, but the new wiki module builds database files\\nfor the v11+ database \\"classic level\\" so Foundry does not need to convert them at startup anymore.\\n\\n## Add SR buttons to actor sheet [Issue #620](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/620)\\nFor linked actors that currently are in combat there is now a row of 12 SR buttons. Clicking one of those will add a combatant\\nto the current combat tracker at that SR, and clicking it again will remove it. There is also a \u24d8 icon with a tooltip that has a\\nreminder about how many SR various actions take. The DEX SR and SIZ SR are visualised by background color as an aid when using this.\\n\\n![](sr-buttons.png)\\n\\n## Reset Initiative removes duplicate combatants [Issue #509](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/509)\\nThe top of the combat tracker is updated so that the \\"Reset Initiative\\" \u21ba button clears all duplicate combatants and their SRs.\\nThe previous buttons \\"Roll All\\" & \\"Roll NPCs\\" are removed since they make no sense for RQG.\\n\\n## Missile weapon SR buttons [Issue #510](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/510) & [Issue #504](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/504)\\nMissile weapons now have buttons for populating the combat tracker at the SRs they can shoot. For weapons with rate S/MR \\nthere are two buttons depending on if you start the round with a loaded arrow or not. The Range and Rate of missile weapons \\nare now shown, both on the combat tab and on the gear tab.\\n\\n![](missile-sr-buttons.png)\\n\\n## Actor name extendedName field [Issue #549](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/549)\\nThe actor name is now divided into the name field and an extendedName / epithet field. The intended use is to keep the \\nname short since that is what is displayed in sidebars, chat etc. The epithet field could then be used for family names \\nor descriptive addons like \\"son of Herila\\" or \\"the dragon slayer\\". As part of this change the layout of the header was \\nalso updated, and if the actorsheet width is reduced the image is hidden to conserve space.\\n\\n![](epithet.png)\\n\\n## Integration with module Drag Ruler [Issue #618](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/618)\\nIf you have the module [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) active then you will get feedback on\\nhow far you can move your token. By default the green color means you are within attack range, a yellow color means\\nyou can get there but cannot attack. Red color means you cannot get there.\\n\\nThere is also support for an optional rule that lets you sprint further than your MOV. See \\"Speed Provider\\" settings\\nin the drag ruler module settings.\\n\\n## Smaller bug fixes, features and refactorings\\n- Actors now fall unconscious when they reach zero magic points [Issue #414](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/414)\\n\\n- CON 0 gives wrong Max ENC [Issue #610](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/610)\\n\\n- Improve restart settings code [Issue #616](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/616)\\n\\n- Improve Active Effect tab [by showing a link to the item an AE originates from [Issue #617](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/617)\\n\\n- add translations for sheet names (items, actor & rollTable)\\n\\n- fix error message for non integer ENC Factor values\\n\\n- make default item icon colors black in the settings dialog"},{"id":"rqg-v3.0.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v3.0.0","source":"@site/releaseNotes/rqg/v3.0.x/2023-08-08-v3.0.0.md","title":"Release Notes RQG 3.0.0","description":"This release drops support for Foundry 10 and introduces support for Foundry 11 so you need to update Foundry to v11 before you can update this system to v3.0.0","date":"2023-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 8, 2023","tags":[{"label":"rqg","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/tags/rqg"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/tags/release"},{"label":"changelog","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/tags/changelog"}],"readingTime":3.005,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rqg-v3.0.0","title":"Release Notes RQG 3.0.0","tags":["rqg","release","changelog"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Release Notes RQG 3.1.0","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v3.1.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release Notes RQG 2.2.6","permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v2.2.6"}},"content":":::warning\\nThis release drops support for Foundry 10 and introduces support for Foundry 11 so you need to update Foundry to v11 before you can update this system to v3.0.0\\n:::\\n\\n## New hit location view for humanoids and improved wounded indications [Issue #290](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/290)\\nFor actors with humanoid hitlocations the display is now more graphical.

Instead they remain on the items, and it is also possible to edit acive effects even on embedded items. The \\"hidden\\" AE debug tab that shows active effects that affect an actor has been updated to take this into consideration. Also the item sheets no longer hide the active effect tab on embedded items.\\nNote: To see the active effect tab run `CONFIG.RQG.debug.showActorActiveEffectsTab=true` in the f12 browser console.\\n\\n## BUG: Rune magic should not be accessible for cult laymembers [Issue #593](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/593)\\nIf you are not initiated into a cult you should not have access to the cults common rune magic.

Now the system default syntax is for example `i.hit-location.left-leg` and there is a macro in the compendium \\"Rqid Macros\\" called \\"Set Hit Location Rqids\\" that can set the correct rqid on all hit-locations (even on those that already has a rqid set).\\n\\nThis syntax is expected by the token effect for protection, so to make that work this macro needs to be run, and at least the humanoid hitlocations needs to be updated.\\n\\n![](hit-location-rqid-dialog.jpg)\\n\\nThis macro will list RQG hit location names and let you match them to the location names from the system settings by drag-n-drop.\\nYellow background means that the name does not exist as a setting. That might be fine if you do not have any creatures that need that hit location. It could also be because you have translated the hit location to another language so that they don\'t match the English names.\\n\\nDrag the names from the right setting table to the corresponding hit location. If you are missing a hit locations to drag from, just add them to the system hit location setting, and rerun this macro.\\n\\nWhen \\"Update\\" is clicked, all hit location items in compendiums, world and scenes will get the standard Rqid for that hit location."},{"id":"rqg-v2.2.4","metadata":{"permalink":"/sun-dragon-cult/release-notes/rqg-v2.2.4","source":"@site/releaseNotes/rqg/v2.2.x/2023-07-08-v2.2.4.md","title":"Release Notes RQG 2.2.4","description":"This release fixes the errors Got unexpected item type in assert, undefined \u2260 skill.

Foundry v11 has done updates to how they work and I will wait to see how it works out in that version before fixing that.\\n\\nThe other fix is that the token actor effects duration now is defined as seconds instead of rounds.
