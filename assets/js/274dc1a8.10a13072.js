sheets\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"639\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"663\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"667\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThere are now two modes on the actor sheet, <ThemeInvert><EditModeSvg /></ThemeInvert> **Edit Mode**\\nand <ThemeInvert><PlayModeSvg /></ThemeInvert> **Play Mode**. You can switch between the modes by\\nclicking on those icons in the actor sheet title bar.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nTo be able to switch between the edit & play mode you need to be a trusted player or higher. Even\\nnormal players can edit their values if their GM switches the mode for them, but they can not change\\nmode themselves.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nIn edit mode it is possible to edit characteristics, rune, skill & passion values. The screenshot of\\nthe skills tab, shows the gained chance input field. The percent chance shown to the right is the\\n\\"normal\\" chance that includes both base chance and skill category bonus, as well as the gained\\nchance.\\n\\n![](edit-mode-skills.png)\\n\\nTo make it easy to see what mode the actor is in, a lot of accent colors are changed to green when\\nit is in edit mode.\\n\\nPlay mode hides some things for the GM to make the actor sheet less cluttered. An example of this is\\nthe `Creature?` toggle that only is available in edit mode.\\n\\nA new actor starts in edit mode, this means that after this upgrade all actors will be in edit mode.\\nYou can easily fix that by clicking on the edit mode toggle, or you can run a script that will be\\nsupplied separately.\\n\\n## Add gear items directly from actorSheet\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"671\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nIt is now possible for players (and GMs) to add new gear (gear, currency & consumables) themselves\\nby clicking on a + icon.\\n\\n![](add-gear.png)\\n\\n## Loosen duplicate embedded item name check\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"672\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nAs a followup to being able to create new gear, it is now also possible to have duplicates.\\nPreviously you could only have one gear, armor or weapon named the same, but now you can have as\\nmany as you like.\\n\\n## Drag a weapon to a pack animal without adding the weapon skills\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"450\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nIf you drag a weapon to an actor the skills linked to that weapon will also be added so that the\\nactor can use the weapon. This is good in most cases, but if you drag a spear to a horse it doesn\'t\\nmake sense that the horse gets the skill to fight with that spear. This issue is solved by checking\\nif the actor you drag the weapon to has arms (specifically a hitlocation with the rqid\\n`i.hit-location.right-arm`) and if it doesn\'t it won\'t add the skills.\\n\\n## Background tab biography field should be player editable\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"670\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nOnly the GM could edit the biography text field on the background tab of the actor sheet. Now\\nplayers can do that too.\\n\\n![](biography-player-editable.png)\\n\\n## Add hit location and rune dropdowns into RqidLink areas\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"656\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nIn all places where you can set a link to a rune or hit-location there now is a dropdown that will\\nadd a link. You can still drag-n-drop to the area but it is hopefully an easier way to adding these.\\n\\nThe lists are populated by looking in compendiums for rqids of rune and hit locations, so if you\\nwould like to add more runes / hit locations, you would need to create a compendium and assign a new\\nrqid to them.\\n\\n![](rune-hit-location-links.png)\\n\\n## Make Hero Points an opt-in setting\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"661\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nHero points are not part of the standard rules but was still shown on the character sheet. You can\\nnow decide if you want them or not with a setting.\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nIf you use the hero points you need to enable them in the settings after upgrading to this release.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Make the characteristics ratings an opt-in setting\\n\\nEach user (GM or player) can now decide if they want to see the rating of the characteristics value\\nas a red / green bar under the value. The setting is per user, but realistically it\'s mostly for GMs\\nto get a quick evaluation of NPCs.\\n\\n![](characteristic-rating.png)\\n\\n## Other Bug Fixes & Improvements\\n\\n- Rqid editor \\"Get Document Like This\\" is not filled in properly\\n  <GithubIssue issue=\\"665\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n- Priests don\'t get the 20% bonus to their POW gain roll\\n  <GithubIssue issue=\\"649\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n- Show an explanation in the Rune Magic tab why nothing is shown as lay member\\n  <GithubIssue issue=\\"668\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />"},{"id":"rqg-v3.3.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v3.3.0","source":"@site/release-notes/rqg/v3.3.x/2023-11-17-v3.3.0.mdx","title":"RQG 3.3.0","description":"Supported Foundry Versions","date":"2023-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 17, 2023","tags":[{"label":"rqg","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/rqg"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/release"},{"label":"changelog","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/changelog"}],"readingTime":2.58,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rqg-v3.3.0","title":"RQG 3.3.0","tags":["rqg","release","changelog"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"RQG 3.4.0","permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v3.4.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"RQG 3.2.1","permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v3.2.1"}},"content":"![Supported Foundry Versions](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://foundryshields.com/version?url=https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/releases/download/v3.3.0/system.json)\\n![Download Count](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/v3.3.0/rqg.zip)\\n\\n:::warning\\n\\nMake sure to update the wiki module to at least version 1.2.0 since this system version includes\\nchanges to document types that needs to be reflected in these documents.

Please note that only equipped ammo will be shown in the dropdown.\\n![](no-ammo.png) ![](ammo-dropdown.png)\\n\\n## Use rqid for armor coverage and remove hit locations setting\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"379\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"380\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe hitlocations were previously identified by name, and the available hitlocations were defined in\\na setting. That setting is now removed and the compendiums in the world are now scanned by the\\nsystem for hit location rqids. This is part of making hit locations translatable, but it also makes\\nit more important that the hit locations actually have a proper rqid, since that is used to identify\\nwhat an armor item protects.\\n\\nYou can either drag and drop a hit location item to the \\"Hit locations\\" area on the armor item or\\nselect one in the dropdown to add it to the set of hit locations the armor item protects.\\n![](armor-sheet.png) ![](armor-dropdown.png)\\n\\n## Change the hit location \\"Connected to\\" field to use rqid instead\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"449\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nTo completely remove any use of hit location names for identification, the \\"Connected to\\" property\\nnow also uses rqid. A hit location item \\"Connected to\\" setting is used in damage calculations. Hit\\nlocations that have a \\"for damage calculations act as\\" set to \\"Limb\\" and also are \\"Connected to\\" a\\nhit location that have \\"for damage calculations act as\\" set to \\"Abdomen\\" will become useless if the\\nAbdomen hit location gets a hard blow.\\n\\nAlso since the rqid now is so important for hit location items it is shown among the other\\nproperties (see screenshot). If you need to edit it, the normal fingerprint icon in the header will\\nopen the rqid editor.\\n\\nThe \\"Connected to\\" dropdown is populated by the hit locations in compendiums that have a hit\\nlocation rqid.\\n\\n![](hit-location-connectedto.png)\\n\\n## Bug Fixes & Improvements\\n\\n- add headbutt & hit as combat maneuvers\\n- spirit Combat panel should not be visible without spirit combat skill\\n  <GithubIssue issue=\\"658\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />"},{"id":"rqg-v3.2.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v3.2.1","source":"@site/release-notes/rqg/v3.2.x/2023-10-26-v3.2.1.mdx","title":"RQG 3.2.1","description":"Supported Foundry Versions","date":"2023-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"rqg","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/rqg"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/release"},{"label":"changelog","permalink":"/release-notes/tags/changelog"}],"readingTime":1.57,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rqg-v3.2.1","title":"RQG 3.2.1","tags":["rqg","release","changelog"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"RQG 3.3.0","permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v3.3.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"RQG 3.2.0","permalink":"/release-notes/rqg-v3.2.0"}},"content":"![Supported Foundry Versions](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://foundryshields.com/version?url=https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/releases/download/v3.2.1/system.json)\\n![Download Count](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/v3.2.1/rqg.zip)\\n\\n\u2022 This release contains a few bugfixes and improvements.

This worked for\\nthe majority of weapons, but could not capture exceptions like sling that is a projectile weapon,\\nbut anyway should get half damage bonus.\\n\\nStarting with this version you need to add `+db` or `+db/2` to the damage string of the weapon if\\nyou want it to include a damage bonus.

It also simplifies the administration of what\\nset of wiki you want since it will be handled by activating / deactivating modules instead of\\nspecialised settings in the system. Having them as a separate module also simplifies releasing\\nupdates since the module can be released independently of the system.\\n\\nThe previous compendium packs were built for the previous Foundry database NeDB, but the new wiki\\nmodule builds database files for the v11+ database \\"classic level\\" so Foundry does not need to\\nconvert them at startup anymore.\\n\\n## Add SR buttons to actor sheet\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"620\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nFor linked actors that currently are in combat there is now a row of 12 SR buttons. Clicking one of\\nthose will add a combatant to the current combat tracker at that SR, and clicking it again will\\nremove it. There is also a \u24d8 icon with a tooltip that has a reminder about how many SR various\\nactions take. The DEX SR and SIZ SR are visualised by background color as an aid when using this.\\n\\n![](sr-buttons.png)\\n\\n## Reset Initiative removes duplicate combatants\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"509\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe top of the combat tracker is updated so that the \\"Reset Initiative\\" \u21ba button clears all\\nduplicate combatants and their SRs.

The intended\\nuse is to keep the name short since that is what is displayed in sidebars, chat etc. The epithet\\nfield could then be used for family names or descriptive addons like \\"son of Herila\\" or \\"the dragon\\nslayer\\".

The full changelog can be found here\\n[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\\n\\n## Weapon\'s skills link _[Breaking!]_\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"290\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nPreviously the link from weapon items to the skills that\'s needed to use them used a Foundry uuid to\\npoint to a skill when the weapon item was not embedded and a item id to point to the skill item on\\nthe same actor when then weapon item was embedded on an actor. This meant that if the weapon skill\\nin your world was deleted, then all weapon pointing to that skill would be broken. Now the skill\\nitem is referenced with a rqid instead, which means that as long as you have at least one skill item\\nin your world or compendium with the correct rqid, the weapon item will find it. Hopefully this will\\nmake the setup more resilient to changes in your worlds.\\n\\nThe Migration will try to find the skill previously linked and use the rqid on that skill to update\\nto the new way of linking skills, if it fails (because it can\'t find a skill with an rqid on it) it\\nwill save the previous values and show \\"NOT FOUND\\" when the weapon use tab is shown, and hovering\\nwill tell you the content of the previous links. In this screenshot the weapon was broken even\\nbefore the migration since both links were \\"undefined\\".\\n\\n![](not-found-weapon-skill-link.png)\\n\\n## Rqid Batch Editor steps\\n\\nStarting to use Rqids for linking weapon skills is a big change and to migrate your worlds I\'ve\\nincorporated a \\"Batch Rqid Editor\\" that is run before the actual migration scrips in order to set\\nRqids on the items that needs it (similar to the CoC one if you\'ve seen that one). It will go\\nthrough all items in your world and for each item that is missing an rqid it will display a row for\\neach distinct name (for example Jump) to let you set the rqid for all items with that name.\\nCurrently it will show forms to set Rqids for skill, rune magic & hit location items one after the\\nother. If it finds an exact match for the name of an item with an existing item that already has a\\nset rqid, then it will autofill that rqid in the form. The \\"Existing Rqids\\" dropdown lists all Rqids\\nthat exist in the system.\\n\\nThere is a \\"magic wand\\" icon to the right of the rqid input field that will take the name of the\\nitem and convert that into a rqid. That can speed up the entering of data a lot, but take care to\\ntry and use the already existing Rqids where possible. The rqid should be in english even if you\\nhave translated the system.\\n\\n**\u26a0 One word of caution** - on my machine the form makes Chrome crash on larger worlds, and after a\\nlot of debugging I came to the conclusion that it was a Chrome extension that went haywire when it\\nsaw this form with all those input fields. It\'s not so fun to come half way into filling this form\\nonly to have everything disappear, so if you want to be on the safe side I would recommend doing the\\nmigration in an incognito window without any extensions.\\n\\n### \u2460 Skills\\n\\nThe important ones to set Rqid on are the weapon skills and Dodge, Jump, Move Quietly & Spirit\\nCombat. The others can be left blank. When it comes to weapon skills there has been a lot of\\nvariation historically what they have been called. Even though it will currently work whatever rqid\\nyou set, I recommend to try and follow this standard for the rqid:\\n\\n**Melee-weapon skills** usually are called something like `1H Daggers (Dagger)` note plural on the\\ncategory `Daggers` which translates to a rqid of `i.skill.1h-daggers-dagger`. Most of you probably\\ndo not have offhand skills, but if you do, the rqid should be the same as the primary hand skill\\nwith a `-offhand` suffix, for example `1h-daggers-dagger-offhand`. There are exceptions like\\nQuarterstaff that only is a category with no specialisation.\\n\\n**Missile-weapon skills** follow the same pattern of category (specialisation), `Javelins (Javelin)`\\nor as rqid `i.skill.javelins.javelin`.\\n\\n**Natural weapon skills** partly follow the same pattern for fist type weapons `Fists (Fist)`, but\\nthere are also one of a kind types like `Grapple` etc.\\n\\n![](weapon-skill-rqids.png)\\n\\n### \u2461 Rune Magic Spells\\n\\nThe system only cares about the common rune magic spells (Command Cult Spirit, Divination, Sanctify,\\nSummon Cult Spirit, Dismiss Magic, Extension, Multispell, Find Enemy, Heal Wound, Soul Sight, Spirit\\nBlock, and Warding). It is used to mark these spells in the rune magic spell list on the actor sheet\\n(see screenshot further down )\\n\\n### \u2462 Hit Locations\\n\\nThe Hit location needs Rqids to make the token hud effects work as they should (the protection\\neffect will search for humanoid bodyparts on the actor). Please set Rqids on the human hitlocations\\n\\"Head\\", \\"Left Arm\\", \\"Right Arm\\", \\"Chest\\", \\"Abdomen\\", \\"Left Leg\\" & \\"Right Leg\\" to the \\"humanoids\\"\\nversion of Rqids. You might see more rows depending on what creatures you have in your world, but\\nyou can ignore the other hitlocations and leave them unset.\\n\\n![](hit-location-rqids.png)\\n\\n## New Syntax for custom active effects _[Breaking!]_\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"442\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe syntax for custom Active Effects that affect items have changed. This is a breaking change and\\nwill need manual fixing when encountered. The syntax for custom Active Effects previously was\\n`<item type>`:`<item name>`:`<affected path>` (for example skill:Dodge:system.baseChance). This is\\nnow changed to `<rqid>`:`<affected path>` (for example i.skill.dodge:system.baseChance). This makes\\nthe AE work in any language as well as simplifying the logic when embedding an item with an AE on an\\nactor. The rqid for an item can be found by opening the item sheet and clicking \\"Rqid\\" in the sheet\\nwindow header. The custom AE now also works on string values (previously it only worked on numbers).\\nFor example you could make an effect that increases weapon damage by 1d6 by setting the \\"Attribute\\nKey\\" to i.weapon.broadsword:system.usage.oneHand.damage and the \\"Effect Value\\" to +1d6.\\n\\n![not-found](string-active-effect.png)\\n\\nWhen you load your world you will get warning logs in the browser console (F12) looking something\\nlike this if you have active effects using the old syntax.\\n\\n![](old-ae-warning.png)\\n\\nFoundry does not let you edit AE on embedded items, so to fix an actor with a broken AE you need to\\ndrag the item to the sidebar, delete the item from the actor, edit the AE on the item and then drag\\nit back to the actor.\\n\\nPlease note that I still consider the custom Active Effects as experimental (only a little less so\\nafter this change).\\n\\n## Sub cult refactoring _[Breaking!]_\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"343\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe previous cult item could not model Orlanths different subcults and still have one rune pool for\\nall of them. Now there is a concept of \\"deity\\" and \\"sub cults\\". Currently this is mostly important\\nfor Orlanth, so if you already have a cult item with the deity Orlanth, when you drag another\\nsubcult of Orlanth to the actor they will get merged so that they share the same pool of rune\\npoints. You can also edit the subcults of a cult item in \\"Cult\\" tab on the cult item sheet.\\n\\n**\u26a0 Please note that if you had entered text in the previous field \\"Subcults\\" that is now gone.**\\nSo before upgrading it could be wise to look at that field for any actors where it might be\\nimportant (read PC actors) and note what subcults they should have so you can manually add them\\nafter the upgrade!\\n\\n## add common rune magic when embedding a cult\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"153\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe cults supplied with the system now has a list of common rune magic spells that you get when\\njoining the cult (there is a field in the cult item sheet where they are listed). When dragging a\\ncult to an actor the actor will get all of those added. Most cults have the same set, but there are\\nexceptions (like Eurmal that has fewer).\\n\\nNote that existing cults items will not get retrofitted with the common runemagic spells\\nautomatically. The common runemagic spells will be marked on the actor sheet with a cult symbol as\\nlong as they got the correct Rqid in the pre-migration Rqid form.\\n\\n![](common-rune-magic-marks.png)\\n\\n## Token HUD Effects\\n\\n<GithubIssue issue=\\"54\\" repo=\\"fvtt-system-rqg\\" />\\n\\nThe token effects have been updated to match some magic spells, like protection (1 - 4), strength,\\nBefuddle, Bladesharp, Bludgeon, Coordination, Counter magic, Demoralize, Dullblade, Fanatacism,\\nFireblade, Glamour, Glue, Ironhand, Lantern, Light, Mobility, Parry, Shimmer, Slow, Spirit screen,\\nVigour, as well as some of the previously ones like Asleep, Prone etc. In addition there are 6\\ngeneral purpose effects. If you install the module\\n[Times Up](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/times-up), the effects with a background all disappear\\nafter 10 melee rounds, and the ones with a brighter orange background actually affect the actor as\\nwell (using active effects).\\n\\n![](token-effects.png)\\n\\n## ActorSheet wounded effects\\n\\nThe actor sheet now makes wounds more immersive, starting with a red tint if the actor is wounded\\ngoing through blurring and eventually greyscale if the actor is shocked, unconscious or dead.\\n\\n## Skills without specialisation warning on Actor Sheet\\n\\nPreviously you would get a dialog forcing you to specify the specialization of a skill that had an\\nunspecified specialization (...) when you dragged it to an actor. Now the skill is embedded - but\\nyou get a warning on the skill-tab that you should complete the skill by entering what the skill\\nspecialization is.\\n\\n![](skill-specialization-warning.png)"}]}')}}]);
