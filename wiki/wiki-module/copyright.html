Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or

(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or
by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files;
and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright,
patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works
that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such
NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative
Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices
normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of
the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the

</li>
<li>
<p>Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under
this License.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
(including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
