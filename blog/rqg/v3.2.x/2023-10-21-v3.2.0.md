## Make damage bonus part of weapon damage string – [Issue #106](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/106)
In previous versions the system tried to figure out if full, half, or no damage bonus should be added to the weapon damage by looking at
if it's a melee, thrown or missile weapon. This worked for the majority of weapons, but could not capture exceptions like sling that is a
projectile weapon, but anyway should get half damage bonus.

Starting with this version you need to add `+db` or `+db/2` to the damage string of the weapon if you want it to include a damage bonus.
The damage listed in the Weapons & Equipment books are expressed in the same way (except they write halv damage bonus like `+½db`).

There is a migration included that should update all existing damage strings.

## Make runes translatable by using rqid for linking – [Issue #270](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/270)
Previous versions used the name of rune items for linking to them, with this change the rqid of the runes are used instead. This
should make it possible to translate the name of the runes.

The links that were changed was; opposing & minor runes links in the rune item, cult item runes, rune magic item runes, and skill runes (used for sorcery spells until a dedicated sorcery spell item type exists). With this change the system setting for the name of the magic rune was removed and the rqid of the magic rune is now a CONFIG instead (set to `i.rune.magic-condition` by default).

There are migrations for all the item changes needed for this.


## Improvements to the rqid editor – [Issue #457](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/457) and [Issue #642](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/642)

The Rqid editor field for the id now autofills the part of the id that fully depends on the document type. It also handles setting
language and priority better when creating a new rqid. You will get default values for that when you set a rqid.

The info display, as well as the list of other items with the same rqid now has an improved display of what folder the document is
located in.

## Hide Opposing / Minor rune settings depending on runeType on Rune Item Sheet – [Issue #269](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-system-rqg/issues/269)
The settings for opposing and minor runes in the rune item sheet are now only shown when they are relevant according to the type of the rune.
