This is a community built system that eventually (not set timeframe) will get Chaosium backed
modules for the Starter Set etc. It is currently a beta version, meaning there might be changes and
additions that could make existing world not work.

## Base concepts

A new actor is almost empty. Most things are items and needs to be added to an actor. There are
compendiums supplied with the companion wiki module with runes, hit locations, spells and skills
among other things to make it easier to build a character. There is only one actor type since that
can handle everything from humans to spirits & dinosaurs. In other words there is no NPC character
type. To make the character sheet clean it does not show the sections that are not yet added. For
example you will not see the skills tab before you have added at least one skill item.

## Wiki Module

\*\*\* Explain wiki There is also a demo actor and some demo items provided for learning the system.
