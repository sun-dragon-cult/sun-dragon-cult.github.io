## RuneQuest Wiki Foundry module

Most content from [Chaosium's RQG wiki](https://rqwiki.chaosium.com/) is included in a Foundry
module that is a required companion to the main [RQG System](/).

The module compendiums are organised into folders:

- Cults & Magic
- Equipment
- Bestiary
- Skills & Passions
- Runes
- Occupations & Places
- Hit Locations
- Macros & Rolltables

:::danger

You will need to have this module active in your world to make the RQG system work since it contains
runes etc that is required for various calculations.

:::

To begin with only an English language version is provided but hopefully more languages will follow.
This is one reason these required compendiums are in a separate module and not in the system itself.
