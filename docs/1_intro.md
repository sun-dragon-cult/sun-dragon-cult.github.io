title: RuneQuest Glorantha Foundry VTT system
tags: [rqg]

Most things are items and needs to be added to an actor. There are a couple of compendiums supplied with the system like 
runes and skills to make it easier to build a character. There is only one actor type since that can handle everything 
from humans to spirits & dinosaurs.

There is also a demo actor and some demo items provided for learning the system. For more detail 
see [Creating a new actor](docs/getting-started/creating-actor)
