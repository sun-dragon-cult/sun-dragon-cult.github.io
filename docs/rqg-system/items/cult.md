To create a Cult, just create a cult item and give it a name and tagline. The cult should also have
a number of runes associated with it and there is a dropdown to select runes from the available
runes. To add another rune just keep selecting runes in the empty dropdown. To remove a rune, delete
the text in the input field.

If you drag the cult item to an actor, it will end up under the
[Rune Magic Tab](/docs/rqg-system/character-sheet/rune-magic)
