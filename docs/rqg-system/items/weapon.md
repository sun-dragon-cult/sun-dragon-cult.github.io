Creating a weapon involves deciding if it can be used one handed, two handed, or a as a missile
weapon.

There are two (three) demo weapons provided - one sword, one bow and arrows that can be used as
ammunition for the bow. The weapons are linked to corresponding weapon skills that are automatically
added to the character when you drag the weapon the the character sheet.

To make the bow use the arrows you need to right click the bow on the character sheet (either on the
combat tab or on the gear tab) and edit the weapon. In the missile section you will find a dropdown
where you can choose what projectile the bow will shoot. The quantity on the projectile (arrow) will
be decreased when you use the bow.
