_or NPC, Monster or Ghost, etc_

A newly created Foundry actor contains very little, and tabs that have no corresponding items are
not shown on the character sheet (making it look very empty). To see examples of how finished actors
can look like you can have a peek in the [Wiki](/wiki/wiki-module) Bestiary folder.

:::tip

The easiest way to create a new character is to duplicate the "Bestiary/Adventurers/Human (Base)"
actor.

:::

If you want to start from a freshly created actor to be able to maximise the customisation, these
are the steps.

## 1) Add Hitlocations

The compendium "Hit Locations/Humanoids" contain the normal humanoid hitlocations. Drag these to the
actor. A tip here is to drag the entire compendium to the actor at once instead of dragging each
individual hitlocation from the compendium by its own. There are other compendiums with hitlocations
for other body types. See [Hit Location](/rqg-system/items/hit-location) for details about this item
type.

## 2) Add Runes

The compendium "Runes/Runes(Player Character)" contains all the runes from the RQG character sheet.
Drag them to the actor in the same way as the hitlocations. If you want to choose from the full set
of runes present in the Chaosium Wiki then have a look in the "Runes/Runes (All)" compendium. More
info about this item type can be found here [Rune item](/rqg-system/items/rune).

## 3) Learn Skills

The compendium "Skills & Passions/Skills" contain skills. Drag all (or a subset) of those skills to
the character. Please note that this compendium contains all skills, including specialised skills
that not all actors have. A better base selection of skills is in the `Human (Base)` actor (see tip
further up). [Skill item](/rqg-system/items/skill) contains more info bout this item type.

## 4) Join a Cult

There is a set of cults predefined - look in the compendium "Cults & Magic/Cults" and drag the cult
of your choice to let the adventurer join a cult. See [Cult Item](/rqg-system/items/cult) for
detailed info about these items.

## 5) Learn a Rune Magic Spell

Again there is a compendium with Rune Magic spells that can be found at "Cults & Magic/Rune Magic
Spells" that you can drag to the actor. More detailed info about this kind of item can be found at
[Rune Magic Spell Item](/rqg-system/items/rune-magic)

## 6) Learn a Spirit Magic Spell

You might already guess how to do this... Look for the "Cults & Magic/Rune Magic Spells" compendium
and drag the ones you want to the actor. More info about this item type can be found at
[Spirit Magic Spell Item](/rqg-system/items/spirit-magic)

## 7) Gain a Passion

Create a Passion item - or use one of the provided Passions in the "Skills & Passions/Passions"
compendium and drag it to the character sheet. [Passion Item](/rqg-system/items/passion) contains
more detailed info.

## 8) Wear Armor

Armor is its own item type, and you can find ready-made armor items at "Equipment/Armor". To
actually be protected you need to equip the armor on the
[Gear Tab](/rqg-system/character-sheet/gear). The equipped icon looks like this

<LightInvertSvg src="/img/equipped.svg" width="18" /> and more detailed info about this item type can
be found at [Armor Item](/rqg-system/items/armor). If you are creating a creature that has natural armor
you should look at [Hit Location Item](/rqg-system/items/hit-location) where that can be specified.

## 9) Get a Weapon

Weapons are the most complex item type, but you can find most weapons you need in the
"Equipment/Weapons" compendium. More details about this item type can be found in
[Weapon Item](/rqg-system/items/weapon). To be able to use the weapon you've dragged to your actor
you need to equip it <LightInvertSvg src="/img/equipped.svg" width="18" />.

Arrows and other ammunition is also weapon items.

## 10) Get wealthy

There are three types of [Gear Items](/rqg-system/items/gear) in the "Equipment/Gear" compendium,
currency gear like Lunar and Wheels, that will show up in the currency table on the
[Gear Tab](/rqg-system/character-sheet/gear), consumable gear with quantity that will show up in the
consumable table, and unique gear that will show up in the gear table.

Some gear items can also contain other items. That is handled with the
[Location](/rqg-system/character-sheet/gear#locations) system.
