Search for "RuneQuest Glorantha" in the Foundry VTT Install System search box and press "Install"
button.

You will also need the "Wiki content for the RQG system" module. When installing the system, it will
ask if you want to install the recommended modules as well. Allow this and when you have created
your world activate the "Wiki content for the RQG system" module.

In addition there are some recommended modules that are not necessary, but adds functionality if
they are installed:

- [Drag Ruler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/drag-ruler) that has an integration to color code
  token movement limits. Please note that at the time of this writing this is not compatible with
  Foundry 12, so please do not activate it if you are using that version.
- [Times Up](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/times-up) that will auto expire token effects like
  protection spells after 10 combat rounds.
