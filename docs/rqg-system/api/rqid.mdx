## What is it for

The RQG System manages content in different languages and different compendiums or in the world by
using a RQG System ID or "rqid". The id's are stored as flags on documents under the "rqg" scope as
an object "documentRqidFlags" containing **id**, **lang** & **priority** properties.

A rqid is not a unique id, instead it defines what "kind" a document is. The purpose is to let
different versions of the same document coexist so the "best" version can be used. A "kind" can be
something like a specific skill like "Dodge", or a description of a specific spell. It also defines
what language the document is written in, and it has a priority that ranks documents with the same
id and language (higher is better).

An advantage of using rqid for links between documents is that the risk of broken links are greatly
reduced, compared to linking documents using the Foundry Uuid. If a link is broken you just need to
either make sure a document matching the requested rqid once again is available in your world or in
a compendium, or change the link to some other rqid that exists. See
[Current usage in the system](/rqg-system/api/rqid#current-usage-in-the-system) for details on what
it's currently used for.

If you want to link to a specific instance of a document you should use the Foundry uuid instead.

## What are the parts

A normal rqid comes in 3 parts separated by dots `.` like this: `i.skill.fast-talk`. It should be
all lower case letters without any spaces.

1. The first part is an abbreviated document type, see below. It supports many different document
   types, but the system only uses links to items and journals so far.

<details>
<summary>Document type abbreviation table</summary>

    |        | Foundry Document Type                                         |
    | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **a**  | Actor                                                         |
    | **c**  | Cards                                                         |
    | **i**  | Item                                                          |
    | **je** | JournalEntry                                                  |
    | **jp** | JournalEntryPage _(Only allowed as embedded in JournalEntry)_ |
    | **m**  | Macro                                                         |
    | **p**  | Playlist                                                      |
    | **rt** | RollTable                                                     |
    | **s**  | Scene                                                         |

</details>

2. The second part is the document subtype if there is any. In RQG there are a number of item types
   like `skill`, `hit-location` and `rune` etc.

3. The third part is usually related to the name of the document in english. If it is a journal
   entry for example is describing the spell bladesharp (rqid `i.spirit-magic.bladesharp`), it can
   be called `je..bladesharp`

:::info rqids for embedded documents

There is also a possibility to link to a document that is embedded. This is mostly useful for adding
a link to a journal entry page inside a journal entry. The rqid for that can look like this
`je..spells.jp..ignite` where the first section (`je..spells`) defines what document it is, and the
appended section (`jp..ignite`) defines what embedded document to find inside that document.

:::

## Search priorities

The available documents matching "rqid" and "lang" will be searched, and it will return the one with
the highest priority. This allows later RQG content packs to override older information. The GM can
also use this to create compendium packs with documents that override the ones provided by the
system.

A search for a document can look like this:
`await game.system.api.rqid.fromRqid("i.skill.act", "es")` to find the best available act skill in
Spanish.

The priorities are:

1. The id has to match the query
2. The language - either the one specified in the query, the world language (as in the setting) or
   the fallback language (english)
3. The found document is in the world - documents in compendium are only searched if no match is
   found in imported world documents.

:::danger

Currently, any document in the world will have a higher "effective" priority compared to a document
in a compendium, even if the priority value is lower.

It's under consideration to change this so the priority is honored no matter where the document is
located.

:::

<details>

{" "}

<summary>Examples of priorities and search results</summary>

A spell item has a rqid link `je..befuddle` to a journal entry that describes that spell. When a
player clicks the link a search is done to find the best match.

Suppose these journal entries describing some spirit magic spells exist:

1. rqid: `je..befuddle`, language: `en`, priority: `0` _(from the wiki module)_
2. rqid: `je..befuddle`, language: `en`, priority: `1000` _(from a future english Red Book of Magic
   module)_
3. rqid: `je..befuddle`, language: `es`, priority: `0` _(from a custom "translation to Spanish"
   module)_
4. rqid: `je..demoralize`, language: `en`, priority: `0` _(from the wiki module)_
5. rqid: `je..demoralize`, language: `en`, priority: `1000` _(from a future english Red Book of
   Magic module)_

- A search for `fromRqid("je..befuddle", "en")` would return journal entry 2, since that has the
  highest priority.
- A search for `fromRqid("je..befuddle", "es")` would return journal entry 3 even though journal
  entry 2 has a higher priority since the language is more important than the priority.
- A search for `fromRqid("je..demoralize", "es")` would return journal entry 5 since there is no
  spanish version with that rqid, but the fallback language is english, and journal entry 5 has a
  higher priority compared to journal entry 4.

</details>

## Current usage in the system

### 1. Open the "best" description of skills, spells etc

A number of RQG items have a "rqidLink" to a journal entry description. The advantage of this is
that the "best" version will be opened. For example if you only have the wiki module installed then
that (limited) description will be opened. If you in the future install a premium module that
contains a more elaborated description with the same rqid, but higher priority, then that will be
opened instead.

This can also be used to change what language version is opened, since the world language setting is
tried first. If no description is found in that language the english version is opened (if that
exists).

:::note For reference, these RQG items that have a rqid description link

- Cult
- Rune
- Rune Magic
- Spirit Magic

:::

:::note discussion

Removing the world language setting and relying on the user language is probably a bad idea since it
could make it hard to know what the players actually will see.

For example a game played in Spanish where one player has selected Swedish as the Foundry language
would mean that the Swedish user would get the default English versions of any linked journal
entries - and they might not match the journals the GM has prepared.

I think it's natural that a game is played in one language (matching the world language setting) and
that all players see the documents in that language. Then again you could argue that since there is
a user language setting in Foundry, and since that will affect the Foundry interface language, it
might make sense to use that instead.

:::

### 2. Identify "special" skills

There are a few skills that need special handling, and these are identified by the system by looking
at the rqid of the skills. This allows the name of these skills to be translated into any language.

- dodge: `i.skill.dodge`,
- jump: `i.skill.jump`,
- moveQuietly: `i.skill.move-quietly`,
- spiritCombat: `i.skill.spirit-combat`,

### 3. Specify what hit locations each armor piece protects

Armor items needs to specify what hit locations they protect. This is accomplished by a list of
rqids for hit location items. When a piece of armor is embedded in an actor and equipped, the
embedded hit location items that matches the rqids in the armor item is found and the protection is
applied.

Note that this usage of rqid does not use the language, instead it only searches for the rqids in
the embedded items of the actor using the `actor.getBestEmbeddedDocumentByRqid(rqid)` function on
the RqgActor class.

_The list of available hit-locations is indexed at startup, see green box further down._

### 4. Link Rune magic spells to runes

Rune Magic spells have a list of rune rqids to identify what runes they can be cast with. When the
spell is cast the rqids are used to find the rune items that are embedded in the actor to figure out
success chances.

_The list of available runes is indexed at startup, see green box further down._

### 5. Link Sorcery spells (skills) to runes

:::danger

Support for sorcery is still alpha level and **will** change, see
[Sorcery](/rqg-system/character-sheet/sorcery).

:::

_The list of available runes is indexed at startup, see green box further down._

### 6. Rune links

Runes use rqid to define what the minor and opposite runes are for a particular rune. Currently only
the "opposite" rune link is used for finding what other Power rune to adjust when a Power runes
chance is adjusted.

_The list of available runes is indexed at startup, see green box further down._

### 7. Active Effects

:::danger

The RQG Active Effects implementation is still alpha level and could change completely, possibly
without a migration for any active effects in current worlds.

:::

The RQG system specific way of adding Foundry active effects to embedded items is to add a `Custom`
active effect where the "Attribute Key" is following the format `<rqid:path>`. For example the
system supplied "protection" token effects use this to add natural armor to an actor. This is
currently done by adding a list of Active Effects like `i.hit-location.head:system.naturalAp` for
each humanoid hit location.

:::note Possible future improvement

- This could be improved if the rqid part could contain partial rqids. In the example above a
  "natural armor" active effect could then be described by a single effect like
  `i.hit-location.:system.naturalAp` and it would affect all hit locations embedded in an actor.
- It's also currently only possible to add values, since the "CUSTOM" change mode is used to
  describe that an item should be affected. Making use of the normal Change Modes like "ADD",
  "SUBTRACT", "MULTIPLY", etc. could improve the usability further.

:::

:::tip Runes and hit location items in compendiums are indexed at startup (usage 3-5)

When (re)loading the browser all compendiums containing all rune and hit location items are indexed
and lists of all unique runes / hit locations that are available are compiled. The world language is
used to select what language should be part of the list, and the highest priority item that matched
the world language for each rqid is kept. These lists are used to populate dropdowns of available
runes / hit locations.

Please note that world runes / hit locations are not part of this indexing, so if you want to add
more runes or hit locations than are provided by the wiki module, then you need to put the extra
items in a compendium pack of your own.

:::

## Using it from a macro

When a macro or module, needs a specific document, for example a Broadsword or the journal entry
describing dwarves, it can call `await game.system.api.rqid.fromRqid("i.weapon.broadsword", "es")`,
where the first parameter is the invariant rqid, and the second parameter is the requested language
code. If you do not include a language code, it will use the language from the setting "world
language" when searching for the document. If the document is not available in the requested
language it will try to find it in English as a fallback before giving up.

:::danger Not Yet Implemented - TODO ⚠️

## Changing language in a world

Actors and items embedded in an actor will not be changed even if you switch language in the world
language setting, or activate a module that contains higher priority versions of the same items.

It should be possible to "migrate" a world to a different language. Or change an English module to
use for example Spanish item names.

It's probably only reasonable to let such a migration affect world items?

Possible ways this could be done:

- A script that goes through all world actors and the embedded items, and for each item overwrites
  the name and possibly other properties from the item with the same rqid, but matching the world
  language.
- A way to migrate a specific actor, maybe with an "upgrade" button on the actor sheet in edit mode
  that searches for the best version of each embedded item and overwrites selected properties from
  there.
