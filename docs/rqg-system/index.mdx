This is a community built system that eventually (no set timeframe) will get Chaosium backed modules
for the Starter Set etc. It is currently a beta version, meaning there might be changes and
additions that could make existing worlds not work, but the expectation is that most such breaking
changes have already been done in previous alpha iterations.

## Base concepts

A newly created actor is almost empty. Most "things" in this system are Foundry items and needs to
be added to the actor. There is required module (the Wiki Module) that contains compendiums with
runes, hit locations, spells and skills among other things that is needed build a character.

There is only one actor type since that can handle everything from humans to spirits & dinosaurs. In
other words there is no NPC character type. To make the character sheet clean it does not show the
sections that are not yet added. For example, you will not see the skills tab before you have added
at least one skill item. See sections about
[Creating an Adventurer](rqg-system/getting-started/creating-actor) and
[Foundry Items](/rqg-system/items) for more information.

## Wiki Module
