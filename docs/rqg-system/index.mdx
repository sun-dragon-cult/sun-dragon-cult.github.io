This is a community built Foundry VTT system that eventually (no set timeframe) will get Chaosium
backed modules for the Starter Set etc. It is currently a beta version, meaning there might be
changes and additions that could make existing worlds not work, but the expectation is that most
such breaking changes have already been done in previous alpha iterations.

## Base concepts

A newly created actor is almost empty. Most "things" in this system are Foundry items and needs to
be added to the actor. There is a required module (the [Wiki Module](/wiki)) that contains
compendiums with runes, hit locations, spells and skills among other things that is needed build a
character.

There is only one actor type since that can handle everything from humans to spirits & dinosaurs. In
other words there is no NPC character type. To make the character sheet clean it does not show the
sections for things that are not yet added. For example, you will not see the skills tab before you
have added at least one skill item. See sections about
[Creating an Adventurer](rqg-system/getting-started/creating-actor) and
[Foundry Items](/rqg-system/items) for more information.

The system will not work without the [Wiki Module](/wiki) being active in your world!
