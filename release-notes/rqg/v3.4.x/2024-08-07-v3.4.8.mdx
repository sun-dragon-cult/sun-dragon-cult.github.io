If your world has a lot of compendiums, you might have got warnings about runes that can't be found,
and that compendiums are not yet indexed while starting. This release should fix that. It also
contains size adjustments of runes icons.

In addition it updated the way the build tools are set up to make it possible to remove the game
system warning about
`The "RuneQuest Glorantha" system's manifest contained the following unknown keys: "type", "release-please-start"`
The other warnings will be removed in the next major RQG release when Foundry 11 support will be
dropped. In addition dependencies are updated, and the package manager is changed from the
deprecated version of yarn to pnpm (this won't affect the game).
