This is a minor release that just contains one improvement. It is now possible to type anything in
the homeland field in the background tab. Up until now it was a dropdown with only preselected
values, you still get the dropdown but can also choose to type freetext into the input field.

There are also some behind the scenes changes of how a release is done (but that doesn't affect the
game).

## Improvement
