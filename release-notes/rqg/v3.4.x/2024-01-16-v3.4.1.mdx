This released is a smaller update, mainly to match the wiki release
[1.3.0](/release-notes/wiki-v1.3.0).

## Rename "Command Cult Spirit (Elemental)" to "Command Cult spirit"

</span>

The common rune magic spell `Command Cult Spirit` was named `Command Cult Spirit (Elemental)` so
that has been changed, and the rqid for it that was changed to `i.rune-magic.command-cult-spirit`
from `i.rune-magic.command-cult-spirit-elemental` along with the journal entry description rqid that
is now `je..command-cult-spirit`. This is a common rune magic that is added to most cults, so to not
break any existing links there is a migration that updates these names and rqids (for English only).

The wiki version [1.3.0](/release-notes/wiki-v1.3.0) has the corresponding change.

## Remove old migrations

</span>

A lot of old migrations have been removed, partly because they no longer should be necessary, and
partly because the code in them was not going to work in Foundry v12 that deprecates a lot of old
style code.

The removal of migrateWeaponItemDamageBonus will make sure any weapon damage bonus definitions are
not overwritten when updating the system. Previously a system update would enforce melee weapons to
get damage bonus, missile weapons to remove any damage bonus and thrown weapons to get half db. Now
the update will leave the weapons as they are defined.

Of the system provided macros, only the assign rqid to journals macro is left.
assign-rqid-to-hit-locations does not work after hit location setting was removed, and
migrate-old-journal-links should not be necessary anymore.
