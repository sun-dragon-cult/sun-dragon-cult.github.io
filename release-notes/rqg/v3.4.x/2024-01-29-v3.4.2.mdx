This released is a smaller update, mainly to fix the issue with mixed languages for runes and hit
locations.

## Mixed languages for runes / hitlocation dropdowns

<GithubIssue issue="689" repo="fvtt-system-rqg" />

If you have runes or items in multiple languages in your compendiums, then you could get a mix of
languages in the dropdowns to select those item type. This fix prioritises:

1. world language (a setting)
2. english (fallback language)
3. any other language

and in each category the item with the highest priority wins.

## Make it possible to drag a compendium pack to an actor

<GithubIssue issue="691" repo="fvtt-system-rqg" />

Until now it's not been possible to drag a compendium of for example hit locations directly from the
compendium to an actor. You would either have to drag each individual hit location or import the
compendium to a folder in the world and drag that folder to the actor.

Now it's possible to drag a compendium folder to an actor to get all items inside it.

## Other Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Make actorSheet getData handling of common runemagic up to 10x faster, assume common runemagic has
  rqid.
