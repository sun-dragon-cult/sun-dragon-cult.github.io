This released contains a bunch of bugfixes that should remove some annoyances. When entering
modifications for rolls in the chat, it no longer loses focus after every key press. The calculation
of the chance to improve skills is no longer incorrectly affected by how much you carry. And other
fixes, see the linked github issues for details.

It also adds a log to the dev tools console to indicate how long caching of runes & hit locations
take. It look like this, and the first line will always take a lot longer than the second, since the
second line will "benefit" from the caching done by the first. You can use this information as an
indication if things are running slowly.

RQG | Caching Runes took: 106.442138671875 ms
RQG | Caching Hit Locations took: 0.569091796875 ms
