• This release contains a few bugfixes and improvements. Notably it no longer hides any rune items
that are embedded on an actor. If there are any runes that aren't shown in the normal tables, there
is another table with the "extra" runes so they can be deleted or edited.

• Also in worlds where the world language is set to something else than English, the Rqid search is
improved. If searching for a Rqid don't find any document, the same Rqid will be searched again for
an English version. This can be used for adding journal descriptions in another language that
fallback to showing the English version if no translation exists.

For example the system provided cult "Ernalda" has a linked description to Rqid `je..ernalda`.
Adding a translated description journal with the Rqid `je..ernalda` and with the same language as
the world would open that journal instead of the english version. At the same time some other cult
that is linked to a description that did not have any translated description would open the English
version.

• The "focus" field on spirit magic items can now be edited by players on the actorSheet spirit
magic tab. Just click on the focus column to edit.
